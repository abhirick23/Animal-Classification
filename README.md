# Animal-Classification

In machine learning, multiclass or multinomial classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of three or more classes (classifying instances into one of two classes is called binary classification).

While many classification algorithms (notably multinomial logistic regression) naturally permit the use of more than two classes, some are by nature binary algorithms; these can, however, be turned into multinomial classifiers by a variety of strategies.

Popular algorithms that can be used for multi-class classification include:

k-Nearest Neighbors

Decision Trees

Naive Bayes

Random Forest.

Gradient Boosting

Here we considered cats ,dogs and horses as the classes among which the classification has to be done .
